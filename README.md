## Setup Angular Environment

### Install Node.jS
Node.js is a javascript runtime that allows you to run javascript outside of the browser. Angular is not a Node.js framework, it's a browser side framework in the end. However, to install and use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/cli) as well as run the Angular application server, you'll need the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime and npm (the Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js which you can install from [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Install Angular CLI
To install the Angular CLI, in a terminal or command prompt type:
```console
$ npm install --global @angular/cli
```

## Create a New Angular App
You can now create a new Angular application by typing:
```console
$ ng new my-first-ng-app
```

## Command Reference
### Commands to Validate Setup
```console
$ node --version
$ npm --version
$ ng --version
```
